# "pinewisped"

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
in my dreams
there’s this lake
and i can’t picture it, but i swear it’s the most beautiful thing i’ve ever seen
g a l l o n s  upon  <i>g a l l o n s</i>  of strawberries, italicized and everything, just like she wrote
and there’s this cliff —
pine trees, lil baldy, a spackling of cedar —
between the two there’s a little boy
sitting on the edge
looking down at the bottom of the lake
and he can see the sand and the reflection —
the light in little lines across the ripples they left behind —
and all at the same time
it’s beautiful, wondrous even
and he’s looking at the waves and the gradient the way the sunlight floats aloft
and thinking about how distance isn’t really the distance…
time, my love, it’s time

he picks up a bucket,
strawberries,
and he feels <i>everything</i>.
