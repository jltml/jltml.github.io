# “endless time”

<pre class="scroll-x">
When I see the neighbors
with their TVs’ fake families and careless comfort fallacies

What of that endless time with Caroline and Logan of mine?;
  was It all just a lie that i left behind?
the past must’ve passed; my neck hurts from looking —
  across the street, past the alley, through the walls, over the valley —
  (now everyone’s gone all along to some other belong; i’m still looking —)
  towards all its loved lost raindrops, but

What of it? I don’t think I’ll stop.
