Ok, so... it's still <i>really good</i>, but for me this one didn't quite pull me in in the way the other three books did. I guess this is the Catch-22 of being so masterful at something — like when an artist/a band releases a new album, and it's good, but it's just not as breathtaking as their old one(s). Same story [for me] here… firstly, Tai, while adorably characterized, felt kind of tacked on compared to all the other main characters. And is he officially a member of the Society? I assume so, but it was a little odd that he kind of just <i>showed up</i> while Kate, Sticky, Reynie, and Constance all had a fully fleshed-out beginning in the first book. His characterization is rather static, as well; all the other characters learned and grew and blossomed over the course of the series (and even within individual books), but Tai kind of just... kept giggling? Super cute, but I just love the development of the others. Anyway, I should quit being so hard on Tai! The book was kind of meh at first but definitely picked up & became more interesting in the second third (ish), without giving away spoilers. Overall, I totally liked it — the other ones are just <i>so good</i>!<br /><br /><i>Also — what did they do to the cover art! I loved the old lettering and style! Even the new one is still super similar, it just doesn't fit in the same way the old one did. Oh well. Also, I kind of liked the old illustrations in the book more, but meh.</i>
