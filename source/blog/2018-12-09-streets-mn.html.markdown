Hello again! I recently got in touch with the editor of [street.mn](streets.mn), a sort of blog about urban planning, planning in general, development, communities, transportation, and basically anything else that fits with those categories. I got an account on WordPress so as to write articles, so one (or some?) should be coming soon. If you haven't/if you're interested in the same sort of stuff as I am, be sure to check them out; they've got lots of good insights into lots of good things.
