## colophon & about this site

This website is built using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)-based [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) under [this repository](https://github.com/jltml/jltml.github.io). Text is set in the [IBM Plex](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) family of fonts.

I began putting this together around May 2018, but I got held up over the summer because of [a few complications](./../blog/a-semi-condensed-synopsis-of-my-lungs), so I returned in earnest in September, and the initial/beta version went live soon thereafter. There've been plenty of mishaps along the way (including me literally deleting the files off my computer; thank goodness for Time Machineâ€¦), and I couldn't have done it without [Brian Oldfield](http://b.oldfield.io), whose indispensable help has gotten me out of many metaphorical corners I've tiled myself into. Actually, it was his website that originally inspired me to use Middleman! Many thanks.

And thank you, too, for visiting! I hope you have a lovely time :)
