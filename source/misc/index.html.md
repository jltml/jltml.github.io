## about this website
I began making this website around May 2018, but I got held up over the summer because of [a few complications](./../blog/a-semi-condensed-synopsis-of-my-lungs), so I returned in earnest in September, and the initial/beta version went live soon thereafter. It's built using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) under [this repository](https://github.com/jltml/jltml.github.io). There've been plenty of mishaps along the way (including me literally deleting the files off my computer; thank goodness for Time Machine)... it seems that coding can be a very self-contradictory sort of thing. I couldn't have done it without [Brian Oldfield](http://b.oldfield.io), whose indispensable help has gotten me out of many metaphorical corners I've tiled myself into. Actually, it was his website that originally inspired me to use Middleman, and I've been known to developer-tool inspect it when trying to figure something out. Thanks a million!

And thank you, too, for visiting! I hope you have a lovely time :)
