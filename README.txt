### My Personal Wesbite

Hi! So this is my personal website, which I finally got working after a few failed attempts. It's built using [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman), a rather brilliant static site generator. I use the [Middleman-Deploy] extension to host it on GitHub Pages (on a domain I bought from gandi.net). To start, I just kept modifying the default "Middleman Is Running" page that's generated upon first setup. I learned as I went (and still am learning), eventually ending up here. A special thank-you to [boldfield](https://github.com/boldfield) for all of the help he's given me :)

Thanks!
