<h2 id="or-a-rather-protracted-exploration-of-a-few-changes-in-st-thomas-academys-history"><em>or:</em> A Rather Protracted Exploration of a Few Changes in St. Thomas Academy’s History</h2>

<h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22">by Jack MapelLentz ’22</h2>

<p>Saint Thomas Academy often likes to humbly boast, in a way, about its rich and colorful history. Years compounded upon years of knowledge, enlightenment, and experience stand behind every new day of learning. Still, many Cadets have no way of understanding the full scope of the events that have taken place within the school’s one hundred and thirty-four year lifespan. I counted myself one among them - that is, until recently, when my interest was piqued by a conversation with an uncle and former student. New questions, previously hidden in plain sight, swirled around my head: <em>what</em> exactly had happened in the school’s myriad years of existence? what was STA like for those who walked the halls of yesteryear? and how were those very halls different than they are today? In an attempt to grasp how our school has evolved through the ages, and discover what changes might have taken place, I turned to Cadets from years past.</p>

<p>Let’s spin the clock back to 1958, when NASA was formed, Sputnik still orbited the Earth, and Elvis was all over the radio. Gerald, better known as Gerry, Brown was a senior at STMA, still located on its shared campus with the College of St. Thomas. “My recollection of our facilities is that they were adequate for the times. We were the ‘poor relation’ to the college on campus - we were second in line to use the facilities, but they <em>were</em> college facilities, so we had access to athletic facilities, lunchroom, library, chapel, et cetera, that were better than most comparable high schools. But we were considered a ‘bother’ to the college people!” More interestingly, the social structure at then-STMA differed greatly from today’s. Unlike the intercity friendships that are now a hallmark of the school, students then stuck to those with whom they shared a city. “The student body was generally divided into three groups with little cross-over: those from St. Paul, those from Minneapolis, and the boarders,” he explained. “Another grouping that sometimes selected your friends for you was the academic practice called ‘homogeneous grouping’,” under which “all the smart kids stayed together for every class,” seated alphabetically. Thus, students whose names fell in close proximity to each other inevitably bonded. One similarity to STA’s present social structure was the coterie-esque Crack Drill Squad, though, on the other hand, Mr. Brown recalls athletes being less tightly-knit than they often are today. Finally, the <em>most</em> peculiar of STMA’s intricacies might have been its trifecta of “social fraternities,” consisting of groups that called themselves the Barons, the Ibis, and the Pits. They “sponsored an annual dress-up dinner dance, had monthly Sunday night meetings (at which drinking usually happened) and had pledging in the fall,” according to Mr. Brown, in which “the pledges wore crazy clothes and did crazy things and got paddled by the ‘pledgemaster.’” The Barons, I learned, were the most sought-after and consisted mostly of athletes and the so-called “Squadders,” whom Mr. Brown categorized as being “what was pejoratively called a ‘clique.’” The Ibis - its members mostly sons of blue-collar workers - originated from St. Paul, while the Pits hailed from across the Mississippi, in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Let’s move onwards through time, past 1965, when STMA became STA and students streamed into its shiny new Mendota Heights campus for the first time. Mr. Bob Slater ’77 had a unique view on the evolution of athletics at STA, being their director. “The facilities are far better today, [and] there are more sports/activities offered now,” he recalled, adding that the number of multi-sport athletes has dwindled over time. He also touched on a bygone era of simple small-scale community: “When I was a student, most of us had grown up playing sports with and against each other. Today, students come from so many different communities that they are not familiar with each other.”</p>

<p>Many Cadets, myself included, walk through STA’s many facilities without thinking about how they’d be standing upon mere dirt only a few short years ago. Nearly every graduate I interviewed commented on the many new structures that dot the campus. “STA has grown substantially since 1985 with the additions of Gerry Brown Stadium, The Hockey Arena, the expansion of the Middle School Building and of course Flynn Hall,” mentioned Mr. David Hottinger ’85. The construction of that lofty new building has certainly been one of the most influential events at STA in the last decade. "When I was at STA,” reflected Mr. Luke Marks ’11, “we had one gym, an incredibly small weight room, and one locker room. As a student I loved all of the different facilities we had, and never gave it a second thought, but now that I am a coach I think it is crazy that we were able to operate as a school with such limited facilities.” “We hardly had any of that stuff when I was there,” said Dr. Jake Lentz ’96. “All we had was a dusty field and the goat corpse we used as a ball.”</p>

<p>Another common refrain in my research was the importance of the elusive-yet-concrete paradigm upon which STA metaphorically stands that’s been christened “the brotherhood.” “Certainly things have changed structurally… The one thing that has not changed is the ‘brotherhood,’” reflected Mr. John Kenney ’85, “I am still close with many of my classmates and always look forward to getting together. The dedicated faculty never changes. Though the faces may change, there has always been a caring and loving atmosphere." His classmate, Mr. Hottinger, concurred: “The brotherhood was a huge component of my experience. My classmates and those in the school cared about each other, challenged each other, had fun together, and in some ways policed each other.” Surprisingly, I learned that the very phrase “brotherhood” entered the vernacular of STA only recently. “When I was here, I don't recall the word ‘brotherhood’ being used,” said Mr. Nick McCarthy ’02. “The bond between cadets certainly still existed, but the use (let alone the overuse) of that word had not really begun in referring to the relationships between cadets.” Likewise, Mr. Marks echoed his remarks: “The idea of having everyone’s back and being more connected than students at other schools was definitely a thing, but we didn't use the word brotherhood.”</p>

<p>While all these major shifts are fascinating, some of the differences in minute details are equally intriguing. Gerry Brown Stadium was turfless until 2008, according to Mr. McCarthy. In addition, eight forty-five minute periods comprised the pre-block schedule. “Formation used to be after first hour,” he told me. “Nobody slapped the podium after a formation announcement. There were no handshakes or hugs after the senior speeches. You just walked back to your spot in formation.” Lunch, too, has undergone quite a few changes. Many Cadets remember the era of Taher’s preprepared meals, prior to the entrance of SAGE. Even before that, though, it differed, with the option of several “a la carte options featuring lots of cookies, cake, pies, and donuts for sale” - an option that was “much less healthy, but quite good.” Besides STA’s food, Dr. Lentz vaguely hinted at disappeared relics of another era: “When I went to STA, it was uphill both ways, to and from. Also there were wolves… Do they still have the bomb shelter?”</p>

<p>While learning how STA’s campus has changed through the ages, both visibly and invisibly, perhaps the most enlightening part of hearing from these past Cadets was listening to them recount their unique experiences as a student. “I think every cadet has a unique experience,” said Mr. McCarthy. “One unique thing was 9/11, which happened my senior year. That was something that I'll never forget. Other things include the new middle school building being opened and going to several state tournament games at the Metrodome and Target Center.” Another memory: “Formation was an incredibly special time during the school day. I was always drawn to the senior speech… even as a middle schooler,” reflected Mr. Marks, “Whether the message was funny, sad, inspiring, or anything else, I loved hearing them as a student, and still do as a staff member,” certainly something that I can attest to. Mr. Patrick Meisch ’10 provided a poetic picture of trench ball during his time as a student. I apologize in advance for the long quotation, but his prose is simply too eloquent to be cut. “Trench Ball was more of a spectator sport back then. The gym would be packed during homecoming and winter weeks with almost every student in the building, walls ringing with cheers and bleachers rumbling with stomps as the teams played with a fervor and passion unrivaled in today’s trap-infused echo of this vaunted bloodsport. The t-shirt jerseys smeared with sharpie and designed at 10PM the previous night are still around, though. This is one of the activities on which I look back most fondly because kids from all walks of life would get together, regardless of background (excluding the perennial crack drill fellas), to dip, dive, duck, and dodge for glory, or at least watch a couple of peers get smashed in the face.” My favorite memory, though, came from Dr. Lentz, regarding one rendition of the notorious senior prank. “When I was a senior,” he wrote, “some of the faculty were ribbing my class for not having done a senior prank the whole year. Then one day in the late spring, while the seniors were out of the school, someone or someones managed to lock everyone else in the school inside and on the upper and lower levels through some creative bike lock use and 2x4 placement. Luckily, there was a construction crew nearby with a diamond-tip saw, and they were summoned by a freshman who was sent out a window.”</p>

<p>Besides investigating the changes throughout the school’s history, I also asked those whom I interviewed about how their time at STA shaped them as a person. Once again, I found, as is the case in many facets of life, it’s the people that make it special. “Well,” Dr. Lentz said when I asked him, “my N is 1, so it is hard to say. But definitely my friends. I was so lucky in my friendships. I still talk to my friends from the Academy weekly, and we see each other as much as possible. That is the biggest thing. All great human beings and all much better than I am in every way.” Both Mr. Hottinger and Mr. McCarthy expressed nearly identical sentiments, backing up STA’s reputation as a unique environment. Another commonality in the responses was the effect of St. Thomas’s rather notorious rigor. “I think overall, and keeping mind the N of 1, STA gave me a sense of the primacy of hard work and teamwork above most everything else. I’m not very smart, but I hustle, and I think the relatively intense and unrelenting grind of being at St. Thomas helped teach me that you gotta work.” Again, others agreed. Mr. Marks expressed his doubts that he would have been held to a similar high standard at another school: “At STA, I was always pushed to do my absolute best…If I hadn't gone to STA for school, I would be a much different person.”</p>

<p>All in all, hearing from these past Cadets gave me a new sense of place. Only now have I fully realized the importance of appreciating those who’ve walked the halls before me… and while I know that not all questions can be answered, it’s clear that the school’s every nook and cranny hides a story waiting to be dusted off, brought forth into light, and told. From the few that I explored in the making of this article, I came to understand that, while St. Thomas Academy will always ebb and flow and adapt to changing times, its foundation, having withstood generation after generation, is truly timeless.</p>
