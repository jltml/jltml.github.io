    <!-- <h1 id="a-swimmingly-splendid-show-vistas-the-little-mermaid">A Swimmingly Splendid Show: ViSTA’s <em>The Little Mermaid</em></h1>

<h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22">by Jack MapelLentz '22</h2>

<p>This spring’s ViSTA musical was utterly unforgettable, proving to be yet another triumph of the theater program. Somehow, the incredible mix of talent managed to transform the de Sales Theater from an unassuming black stage into an suboceanic paradise. Each and every one of its intricacies was thoughtfully considered, and it showed: from Ariel’s transformation from mermaid to human, the perfectly-choreographed rendition of <em>Under the Sea</em>, to the adorable <em>Kiss the Girl</em>, everything was performed exquisitely.</p>

<p>The curtain opens on Ariel, played excellently by Xuan Nguyen, in “The World Above.” Next, the pilot (portrayed by Colby Wong) and Prince Grimsby (Sam Cunniff) make their debut, joined onstage by the ship’s sailors. From there, the actors and actresses beautifully weave a tale of good, evil, love, hate, and everything in between. The graceful songs of the Mersisters follow; after this, Joe McMahon makes his appearance as King Triton. All too soon, though, the show’s antagonists slither onstage: Ursula, alongside her loyal companions Flotsam and Jetsam (portrayed to a tee by Janae Lorick, Nick Horst, and Jack Kelly, respectively), launch into their first performance, “Daddy’s Little Angel.” Finally, after the trio finally departs (for now), Ariel makes a magnificent return with the iconic standout solo “Part of Your World.” The Mersisters and Flounder swim back centerstage for “She’s in Love,” spreading news of Ariel’s newfound romance far and wide among the creatures of the sea.</p>

<p>From here on, I’ll do my best not to spoil the plot (though if you’ve somehow managed thus far not to know the plot of The Little Mermaid, you have gained my respect). Some highlights of the ensuing scenes include the legendary George Budzius as Prince Eric in “Her Voice;” Ethan Kalafatich’s perfect voicing of Sebastian, especially in “Under the Sea”; the arrival (crash landing?) of Scuttle - played with an impeccable accent by Pawel Williams - alongside the gulls; “Les Poissons,” featuring Lauren Wohlberg as Chef Louise; and “Kiss the Girl,” again featuring Ethan as Sebastian in its lead role. All this ends in a stunning finale, with the full company joining each other onstage for a well-deserved round of applause.</p>

<p>If you haven’t yet noticed my generous use of superlatives, I loved the show. As I said before, every nook and cranny - from continuous swimming movements among those onstage to Scuttle’s aforementioned tumble from stage right to the show’s shipshape crews - is executed perfectly, with a unique flair characteristic of the amazing people behind the costumes. It’s made even better when one considers how everyday figures in their life, like those you run into in the hallway or smile at between classes, somehow manage to assume an entirely different persona and do so flawlessly. I find it incredible to remember that each of the people that I sit next to in my French class were the very same as those under the lights only a few nights prior. Some cast members are my oldest friends, and seeing them perform so splendidly and with such heart and soul reminds me just how lucky I am to know them. This personal connection adds a whole new layer of meaning to the show, and no mainstream production could ever hope to replicate it.</p>

<p>When all of these aspects are combined, I find it nearly impossible <em>not</em> to love <em>The Little Mermaid</em>. Honestly, its only pitfall might be the lack of intense emotions à la <em>Les Miserables</em> or <em>Little Women</em> - but it easily surpasses this setback through pure charm. It manages to entertain every single audience member, regardless of age, thanks to the immense efforts of the entire company. All in all, the show went, shall I say, <em>swimmingly</em>.</p>

<h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22">by Jack MapelLentz '22</h2>

<p>On Tuesday, November 13th, 2018, the iconic Targets of the Twin Cities opened up for another day of business. Their glass doors slid open across the metro, near-simultaneously, to those awaiting outside; on shelves were copies of the <em>Cities 97 Sampler Volume 30</em>, aptly titled <em>The Final Chapter.</em> For this day was indeed the conclusion to a beautiful, touching story: over its 30 years of existence, the <em>Sampler</em> not only compiled unique, heartwarming, and intimate renditions of often-stunning songs; its sales also raised above $13 million for charities across Minnesota.</p>

<p>Most likely, the majority of you have never heard of the <em>Sampler.</em> Perhaps you’ve been unknowingly touched by its charitable impact. Alas, a rundown: first released in 1989 (a year the Swifties will recognize), it consisted of seventeen songs, give or take a few, burned onto a CD yearly to be distributed on a crisp November morning at the aforementioned Targets. Some years, especially during the <em>Sampler’s</em> renaissance, hardy lovers of alternative music would stand for hours in line outside Target’s doors in a freezing sea of snowflakes just to listen to 75-ish minutes of music. Why, you may ask? It’s basically impossible to beat its singularity unique, cozy, and idiosyncratic recordings of (usually well-known) songs. Most[^Some were recorded at Cities 97-sponsored events like the Basilica Block Party, etc] were recorded in front of an audience comprised of only a few people at Cities 97’s St. Louis Park-located Studio C, a name that, for me, instantaneously triggers a landslide of childhood memories: watching Kare 11’s weather channel (11-2!) before school, driving from Mahtomedi on I-694 as the sun rose, the worn gray lightly-patterned fabric seats of our trusty 2006 Saturn Ion. For many listeners, myself included, all these seemingly insignificant songs are inexplicably tied to their very identity as a “true” Minnesotan.</p>

<p>Every fall, as <em>Sampler</em> release day inched closer, I’d sit in the left backseat of the black Ion staring out the window as traffic slowed at the Wakota Bridge; as we flowed among the cars, Brian Oake - then the voice of 97.1 - would mention a sample of one of the soon-to-be-released songs, and I’d quickly lose myself in the music. Finally, on the morning of release, after what seemed to me like years of waiting, my dad would rouse my brother and me well before the sun had graced the horizon. Those days, 694 was always empty. Passing from the frigid and dark morning, over snow-covered concrete, and through the automatic doors onto the fluorescent-lit white tiles of Target, the <em>Sampler</em> always sat ahead in neat rows on the end of an aisle. Crunching through the powder back to the Ion, we would slide it into its now-antiquated CD player, embarking on the year’s musical tale once more.</p>

<p>Soon after this, at school: “Jack, why are you late?” they’d ask me. “Sorry. We were getting the Cities 97 Sampler,” I’d reply, stated as a fact, as if there was no alternative… and, honestly, there was none. By then, the <em>Sampler</em> was long ingrained within my identity.</p>

<p>Between then and now, years passed, life whizzed by, and the <em>Sampler’s</em> volume number increased without relent. CDs faded into obsolescence, but it remained committed to the medium. I, and probably many other listeners, never considered that a November sans <em>Sampler</em> would ever come. But come it did; on October 3rd, the station announced that Volume 30 would be its last. CDs, they said, simply weren’t prevalent enough anymore. No one even had devices that could play them, and regulations for digital releases are significantly more byzantine than physical ones. My heart sank.</p>

<p>Forty-one days later, we entered our garage and climbed my dad’s car, no longer the Ion. I now sat in the passenger seat, not the back, driving to the nearest Target. We passed through the automatic doors from the chilly, gray day into the store. The shelves were empty. They had sold out. Oh well. That’s just how it would have to end.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, looking through my slightly insane number of tabs on my computer, I clicked on one that I’d left open for months: Target’s page for the <em>Sampler’s</em> Volume 30. “Add to cart,” it said. Huh. So we did as the button said; days later, it showed up in a little cardboard box in our tattered mailbox. I now hold it in my hand, waiting to pull the old MacBook out from under my bed, the only device in our house equipped to import CDs.</p>

<p>But before that, I think I’ll listen to the older volumes. You simply can’t beat The Fray and Death Cab for Cutie on Volume 18; The Head and the Heart, Farewell Milwaukee, and Mumford &amp; Sons on Volume 23; Brandi Carlile on Volume 24; or Colbie Caillat, John Mayer, and Guster on Volume 22 - which is perhaps my favorite. On its closing track, Ingrid Michaelson says, introducing the song, “Um, we’re gonna do a Mexican song. Well, it’s a- it’s the song ‘Ode to Mexican Food,’” before launching into a jovial cover of <em>Maybe,</em> from her own album <em>Everybody</em>, except the lyrics begin with “I don’t know what I’m gonna eat tonight.” Or Ben Rector on Volume 28, replacing a line in “Brand New” with “I feel like windows rolled down / That’s because it’s hotter than it’s ever been before,” following up with “I feel like for the first time / I am in an oven that’s set to bake / I feel like any sort of baked item,” poking fun at an ongoing heat wave. When paired with their more serious counterparts, songs like these are what give the <em>Cities 97 Samplers</em> a heart and soul all their own. And while we might not be getting a new disc every year, volumes of the past will undoubtedly live on in memory.</p>

<p>By now, I know well enough that, when all’s said and done, memories are sometimes the only things we’re left with. As you have most likely discerned, I lament the loss of such a musical staple… but is it really gone? Who knows; in the future, maybe it’ll come back. All in all, I’m simply grateful that I ever had the chance to experience its era. I’m grateful for its charitable aspect and the countless lives impacted. I’m grateful for all the incredibly talented artists that performed at Studio C, and the masterpieces they’ve created. But, above all, I’m grateful for the way that the <em>Cities 97 Sampler</em> has shaped my musical taste, and, by extension, me, for music is embedded within my consciousness. I think that I can say without doubt that without the <em>Sampler</em> I would be a noticeably different person. It’s the little things that keep us afloat in this crazy, beautiful river of life. I remind you: realize and acknowledge them while they’re still among you; when they flow away, recall how much you loved them.</p>

<h2 id="or-a-rather-protracted-exploration-of-a-few-changes-in-st-thomas-academys-history"><em>or:</em> A Rather Protracted Exploration of a Few Changes in St. Thomas Academy’s History</h2>

<h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22">by Jack MapelLentz ’22</h2>

<p>Saint Thomas Academy often likes to humbly boast, in a way, about its rich and colorful history. Years compounded upon years of knowledge, enlightenment, and experience stand behind every new day of learning. Still, many Cadets have no way of understanding the full scope of the events that have taken place within the school’s one hundred and thirty-four year lifespan. I counted myself one among them - that is, until recently, when my interest was piqued by a conversation with an uncle and former student. New questions, previously hidden in plain sight, swirled around my head: <em>what</em> exactly had happened in the school’s myriad years of existence? what was STA like for those who walked the halls of yesteryear? and how were those very halls different than they are today? In an attempt to grasp how our school has evolved through the ages, and discover what changes might have taken place, I turned to Cadets from years past.</p>

<p>Let’s spin the clock back to 1958, when NASA was formed, Sputnik still orbited the Earth, and Elvis was all over the radio. Gerald, better known as Gerry, Brown was a senior at STMA, still located on its shared campus with the College of St. Thomas. “My recollection of our facilities is that they were adequate for the times. We were the ‘poor relation’ to the college on campus - we were second in line to use the facilities, but they <em>were</em> college facilities, so we had access to athletic facilities, lunchroom, library, chapel, et cetera, that were better than most comparable high schools. But we were considered a ‘bother’ to the college people!” More interestingly, the social structure at then-STMA differed greatly from today’s. Unlike the intercity friendships that are now a hallmark of the school, students then stuck to those with whom they shared a city. “The student body was generally divided into three groups with little cross-over: those from St. Paul, those from Minneapolis, and the boarders,” he explained. “Another grouping that sometimes selected your friends for you was the academic practice called ‘homogeneous grouping’,” under which “all the smart kids stayed together for every class,” seated alphabetically. Thus, students whose names fell in close proximity to each other inevitably bonded. One similarity to STA’s present social structure was the coterie-esque Crack Drill Squad, though, on the other hand, Mr. Brown recalls athletes being less tightly-knit than they often are today. Finally, the <em>most</em> peculiar of STMA’s intricacies might have been its trifecta of “social fraternities,” consisting of groups that called themselves the Barons, the Ibis, and the Pits. They “sponsored an annual dress-up dinner dance, had monthly Sunday night meetings (at which drinking usually happened) and had pledging in the fall,” according to Mr. Brown, in which “the pledges wore crazy clothes and did crazy things and got paddled by the ‘pledgemaster.’” The Barons, I learned, were the most sought-after and consisted mostly of athletes and the so-called “Squadders,” whom Mr. Brown categorized as being “what was pejoratively called a ‘clique.’” The Ibis - its members mostly sons of blue-collar workers - originated from St. Paul, while the Pits hailed from across the Mississippi, in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Let’s move onwards through time, past 1965, when STMA became STA and students streamed into its shiny new Mendota Heights campus for the first time. Mr. Bob Slater ’77 had a unique view on the evolution of athletics at STA, being their director. “The facilities are far better today, [and] there are more sports/activities offered now,” he recalled, adding that the number of multi-sport athletes has dwindled over time. He also touched on a bygone era of simple small-scale community: “When I was a student, most of us had grown up playing sports with and against each other. Today, students come from so many different communities that they are not familiar with each other.”</p>

<p>Many Cadets, myself included, walk through STA’s many facilities without thinking about how they’d be standing upon mere dirt only a few short years ago. Nearly every graduate I interviewed commented on the many new structures that dot the campus. “STA has grown substantially since 1985 with the additions of Gerry Brown Stadium, The Hockey Arena, the expansion of the Middle School Building and of course Flynn Hall,” mentioned Mr. David Hottinger ’85. The construction of that lofty new building has certainly been one of the most influential events at STA in the last decade. "When I was at STA,” reflected Mr. Luke Marks ’11, “we had one gym, an incredibly small weight room, and one locker room. As a student I loved all of the different facilities we had, and never gave it a second thought, but now that I am a coach I think it is crazy that we were able to operate as a school with such limited facilities.” “We hardly had any of that stuff when I was there,” said Dr. Jake Lentz ’96. “All we had was a dusty field and the goat corpse we used as a ball.”</p>

<p>Another common refrain in my research was the importance of the elusive-yet-concrete paradigm upon which STA metaphorically stands that’s been christened “the brotherhood.” “Certainly things have changed structurally… The one thing that has not changed is the ‘brotherhood,’” reflected Mr. John Kenney ’85, “I am still close with many of my classmates and always look forward to getting together. The dedicated faculty never changes. Though the faces may change, there has always been a caring and loving atmosphere." His classmate, Mr. Hottinger, concurred: “The brotherhood was a huge component of my experience. My classmates and those in the school cared about each other, challenged each other, had fun together, and in some ways policed each other.” Surprisingly, I learned that the very phrase “brotherhood” entered the vernacular of STA only recently. “When I was here, I don't recall the word ‘brotherhood’ being used,” said Mr. Nick McCarthy ’02. “The bond between cadets certainly still existed, but the use (let alone the overuse) of that word had not really begun in referring to the relationships between cadets.” Likewise, Mr. Marks echoed his remarks: “The idea of having everyone’s back and being more connected than students at other schools was definitely a thing, but we didn't use the word brotherhood.”</p>

<p>While all these major shifts are fascinating, some of the differences in minute details are equally intriguing. Gerry Brown Stadium was turfless until 2008, according to Mr. McCarthy. In addition, eight forty-five minute periods comprised the pre-block schedule. “Formation used to be after first hour,” he told me. “Nobody slapped the podium after a formation announcement. There were no handshakes or hugs after the senior speeches. You just walked back to your spot in formation.” Lunch, too, has undergone quite a few changes. Many Cadets remember the era of Taher’s preprepared meals, prior to the entrance of SAGE. Even before that, though, it differed, with the option of several “a la carte options featuring lots of cookies, cake, pies, and donuts for sale” - an option that was “much less healthy, but quite good.” Besides STA’s food, Dr. Lentz vaguely hinted at disappeared relics of another era: “When I went to STA, it was uphill both ways, to and from. Also there were wolves… Do they still have the bomb shelter?”</p>

<p>While learning how STA’s campus has changed through the ages, both visibly and invisibly, perhaps the most enlightening part of hearing from these past Cadets was listening to them recount their unique experiences as a student. “I think every cadet has a unique experience,” said Mr. McCarthy. “One unique thing was 9/11, which happened my senior year. That was something that I'll never forget. Other things include the new middle school building being opened and going to several state tournament games at the Metrodome and Target Center.” Another memory: “Formation was an incredibly special time during the school day. I was always drawn to the senior speech… even as a middle schooler,” reflected Mr. Marks, “Whether the message was funny, sad, inspiring, or anything else, I loved hearing them as a student, and still do as a staff member,” certainly something that I can attest to. Mr. Patrick Meisch ’10 provided a poetic picture of trench ball during his time as a student. I apologize in advance for the long quotation, but his prose is simply too eloquent to be cut. “Trench Ball was more of a spectator sport back then. The gym would be packed during homecoming and winter weeks with almost every student in the building, walls ringing with cheers and bleachers rumbling with stomps as the teams played with a fervor and passion unrivaled in today’s trap-infused echo of this vaunted bloodsport. The t-shirt jerseys smeared with sharpie and designed at 10PM the previous night are still around, though. This is one of the activities on which I look back most fondly because kids from all walks of life would get together, regardless of background (excluding the perennial crack drill fellas), to dip, dive, duck, and dodge for glory, or at least watch a couple of peers get smashed in the face.” My favorite memory, though, came from Dr. Lentz, regarding one rendition of the notorious senior prank. “When I was a senior,” he wrote, “some of the faculty were ribbing my class for not having done a senior prank the whole year. Then one day in the late spring, while the seniors were out of the school, someone or someones managed to lock everyone else in the school inside and on the upper and lower levels through some creative bike lock use and 2x4 placement. Luckily, there was a construction crew nearby with a diamond-tip saw, and they were summoned by a freshman who was sent out a window.”</p>

<p>Besides investigating the changes throughout the school’s history, I also asked those whom I interviewed about how their time at STA shaped them as a person. Once again, I found, as is the case in many facets of life, it’s the people that make it special. “Well,” Dr. Lentz said when I asked him, “my N is 1, so it is hard to say. But definitely my friends. I was so lucky in my friendships. I still talk to my friends from the Academy weekly, and we see each other as much as possible. That is the biggest thing. All great human beings and all much better than I am in every way.” Both Mr. Hottinger and Mr. McCarthy expressed nearly identical sentiments, backing up STA’s reputation as a unique environment. Another commonality in the responses was the effect of St. Thomas’s rather notorious rigor. “I think overall, and keeping mind the N of 1, STA gave me a sense of the primacy of hard work and teamwork above most everything else. I’m not very smart, but I hustle, and I think the relatively intense and unrelenting grind of being at St. Thomas helped teach me that you gotta work.” Again, others agreed. Mr. Marks expressed his doubts that he would have been held to a similar high standard at another school: “At STA, I was always pushed to do my absolute best…If I hadn't gone to STA for school, I would be a much different person.”</p>

<p>All in all, hearing from these past Cadets gave me a new sense of place. Only now have I fully realized the importance of appreciating those who’ve walked the halls before me… and while I know that not all questions can be answered, it’s clear that the school’s every nook and cranny hides a story waiting to be dusted off, brought forth into light, and told. From the few that I explored in the making of this article, I came to understand that, while St. Thomas Academy will always ebb and flow and adapt to changing times, its foundation, having withstood generation after generation, is truly timeless.</p>

<h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22">by Jack MapelLentz '22</h2>

<p>Thanks to the incredible efforts of both the players and coaches - including Mr. Tony Kinzley, Chief Kimberly Freide, Mr. Andrew Hayden, plus Mrs. Anne McQuillan, the iconically kind Middle School coach - STA’s cross-country team has had an equally incredible season thus far. Despite the departure of Ryan Tracy (last year’s top runner), the varsity runners preformed exceptionally well, even against significantly larger schools, and the junior varsity is stronger than it’s been in years.</p>

<p>A new training plan was implemented this year by coach Tony Kinzley, and it’s already showing its effects. “I think the new training plan is awesome,” said senior Luke Kolar, the team’s fastest runner, “I can already see improvements at all skill levels for runners this year. Also, I'm sure the team will see long-term benefits for younger runners who are starting on this plan.”</p>

<p>After the inaugural three weeks of the training plan, the competition kicked off on August 31st in Rosemount at the Irish Invitational (a two-mile race), a course that just so happened to be situated next to an active construction site. It was followed a week later by the Fairbault Invitational, a longer five-kilometer course. In Fairbault, Luke Kolar and Thomas Thurlow both received awards for finishing in ninth and eighteenth place, respectively. Overall, the both the varsity and junior varsity teams led a strong showing against schools with a significantly larger student body, especially that early in the season.</p>

<p>Following two more weeks of training (including the rather notorious VO2max intervals), on September 22nd, the team boarded a bus bound for Milaca, ready to compete in the eponymous Mega-Meet. The Cadets hadn’t made an appearance in three years, having last competed in 2015. An hour and a half later, they pulled into a rural street packed to the brim with buses: the Milaca Mega-Meet is one of the largest in the entire country, with over 160 teams competing. After walking the mile from the bus’s parking spot to the entrance, they navigated the sea of tents and began warming up. It wasn’t expected to be a “PR course” - that is, a course in which one sets their personal record time - but conditions turned out to be near-perfect, and every single runner raced their season PR.</p>

<p>How did they run such wonderful races? A special emphasis on control: “The key to a successful race is to go out at a steady pace. A runner needs to be consistent, and that means saving energy to run even splits for the second and third miles. It's hard to master this skill, and some runners never do,” according to Luke Kolar.</p>

<p>Later, the following Friday, the top ten varsity runners visited the University of Minnesota for a scouting practice of sorts. They returned the next day to experience (and race in) the Roy Griak Invitational, a meet in which incredibly fast college athletes compete - and a tough, hilly course. That night, they reconvened at Noodles &amp; Company to continue a tradition from past years.</p>

<p>On October 6th, the team made the two-and-a-half hour trip up I-94 to Alexandria, making a pit stop at St. John’s along the way (though a logistical hiccup meant that the seniors didn’t receive their beloved Johnnie Bread). Though they had to endure some, well, <em>questionable</em> movie choices (you can thank Kevin Murphy for that), they eventually arrived at the Arrowhead Resort ready to race. Conditions were once again good, though the course was a bit sloppy, and in the end, the team once again held its own in a competitive race.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the future, the sections meet is only a couple short weeks away, and the team is optimistic. “I’m hoping that our team will win conference and perform well in Sections. Don't want to 'count any chickens before they hatch,' but I predict our team will see success in the coming weeks.”</p>

<p>It might be hard for someone who’s never participated in cross-country to fathom why all these crazy people would run their hearts out, but it’s human connections that make the sport worthwhile. “The best part of cross-country is the people. Whether it be coaches or people, running is actually a great sport for getting to know people - and the people I've met I couldn't be more grateful for,” said Luke. It is these people that make each and every day an unforgettable, unique experience… and this season, so far, has been filled to the brim with them.</p>
