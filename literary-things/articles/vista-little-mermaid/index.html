<h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22">by Jack MapelLentz '22</h2>

<p>This spring’s ViSTA musical was utterly unforgettable, proving to be yet another triumph of the theater program. Somehow, the incredible mix of talent managed to transform the de Sales Theater from an unassuming black stage into an suboceanic paradise. Each and every one of its intricacies was thoughtfully considered, and it showed: from Ariel’s transformation from mermaid to human, the perfectly-choreographed rendition of <em>Under the Sea</em>, to the adorable <em>Kiss the Girl</em>, everything was performed exquisitely.</p>

<p>The curtain opens on Ariel, played excellently by Xuan Nguyen, in “The World Above.” Next, the pilot (portrayed by Colby Wong) and Prince Grimsby (Sam Cunniff) make their debut, joined onstage by the ship’s sailors. From there, the actors and actresses beautifully weave a tale of good, evil, love, hate, and everything in between. The graceful songs of the Mersisters follow; after this, Joe McMahon makes his appearance as King Triton. All too soon, though, the show’s antagonists slither onstage: Ursula, alongside her loyal companions Flotsam and Jetsam (portrayed to a tee by Janae Lorick, Nick Horst, and Jack Kelly, respectively), launch into their first performance, “Daddy’s Little Angel.” Finally, after the trio finally departs (for now), Ariel makes a magnificent return with the iconic standout solo “Part of Your World.” The Mersisters and Flounder swim back centerstage for “She’s in Love,” spreading news of Ariel’s newfound romance far and wide among the creatures of the sea.</p>

<p>From here on, I’ll do my best not to spoil the plot (though if you’ve somehow managed thus far not to know the plot of The Little Mermaid, you have gained my respect). Some highlights of the ensuing scenes include the legendary George Budzius as Prince Eric in “Her Voice;” Ethan Kalafatich’s perfect voicing of Sebastian, especially in “Under the Sea”; the arrival (crash landing?) of Scuttle - played with an impeccable accent by Pawel Williams - alongside the gulls; “Les Poissons,” featuring Lauren Wohlberg as Chef Louise; and “Kiss the Girl,” again featuring Ethan as Sebastian in its lead role. All this ends in a stunning finale, with the full company joining each other onstage for a well-deserved round of applause.</p>

<p>If you haven’t yet noticed my generous use of superlatives, I loved the show. As I said before, every nook and cranny - from continuous swimming movements among those onstage to Scuttle’s aforementioned tumble from stage right to the show’s shipshape crews - is executed perfectly, with a unique flair characteristic of the amazing people behind the costumes. It’s made even better when one considers how everyday figures in their life, like those you run into in the hallway or smile at between classes, somehow manage to assume an entirely different persona and do so flawlessly. I find it incredible to remember that each of the people that I sit next to in my French class were the very same as those under the lights only a few nights prior. Some cast members are my oldest friends, and seeing them perform so splendidly and with such heart and soul reminds me just how lucky I am to know them. This personal connection adds a whole new layer of meaning to the show, and no mainstream production could ever hope to replicate it.</p>

<p>When all of these aspects are combined, I find it nearly impossible <em>not</em> to love <em>The Little Mermaid</em>. Honestly, its only pitfall might be the lack of intense emotions à la <em>Les Miserables</em> or <em>Little Women</em> - but it easily surpasses this setback through pure charm. It manages to entertain every single audience member, regardless of age, thanks to the immense efforts of the entire company. All in all, the show went, shall I say, <em>swimmingly</em>.</p>
