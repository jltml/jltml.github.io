    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: it's &lt;a href="http://jltml.me/whose-land-is-it" target="_blank"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago, I quickly cobbled together a new website, inspired by &lt;a href="https://heyman.info" target="_blank"&gt;Jonatan Heyman&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://whatismyzip.com" target="_blank"&gt;whatismyzip.com&lt;/a&gt;. I'd thought — what if you could immediately load a page and see whose land you're on (like how you can on whatismyzip with ZIP codes)? And so, after discovering that JavaScript is Not That Much Fun, I put together &lt;a href="http://jltml.me/whose-land-is-it" target="_blank"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; page, which does exactly that. It looks &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; bad right now, but hopefully I'll get it to look better here soon (though it does support dark mode? honestly people everyone should; it's not hard). Anyway, it pretty much just uses your location to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;give you back your location (using an API from the FCC) so the person using the website is like "ok yes it's working"&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;uses the wonderful &lt;a href="https://native-land.ca" target="_blank"&gt;native-land.ca&lt;/a&gt; API to give you the territories based on your location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;also embeds that map on the left, once again from &lt;a href="https://native-land.ca" target="_blank"&gt;native-land.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it's pretty much just a super-simplified wrapper around &lt;a href="https://native-land.ca" target="_blank"&gt;native-land.ca&lt;/a&gt;. But, I mean, at the same time… how awesome is that website, right! (I mean native-land.ca, not my own.) What an incredible, meaningful application of giant datasets and mapping. My goodness, I love maps so much.&lt;/p&gt;

When I see the neighbors
with their TVs’ fake families and careless comfort fallacies

What of that endless time with Caroline and Logan of mine?;
  was It all just a lie that i left behind?
the past must’ve passed; my neck hurts from looking —
  across the street, past the alley, through the walls, over the valley —
  (now everyone’s gone all along to some other belong; i’m still looking —)
  towards all its loved lost raindrops, but

What of it? I don’t think I’ll stop.

&lt;p&gt;Genres: the quest to fulfill humans’ insatiable desire to sort everything; to quantify. One might think that pop music would be the most, well, popular, right? Think again: rap and hip-hop, as I’m sure you’re all well aware, have taken the world by storm. The vast majority of kids don their headphones and queue up some Juice WRLD; Trippie Redd; Lil Uzi Vert. I, too, as I write this, am listening to a masterpiece. Yet, if I had to guess, I’m sure that none of you have heard of it: Bon Iver’s &lt;em&gt;22, A Million&lt;/em&gt;. Few other albums or artists — and few other things, in general — can etheralize my emotions anywhere near as eloquently as Justin Vernon’s aching falsetto and exquisitely existential-yet-introspective lyrics. Alas, you have never heard of him. I know one person has, though; you may have heard of &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;: Kanye West. After hearing the song “Woods” off Bon Iver’s 2009 EP &lt;em&gt;Blood Bank,&lt;/em&gt; he crowned Vernon his “favorite living artist,” saying that “I love Justin the way Kanye loves Kanye.” Listen to his &lt;em&gt;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; — considered by many to be one of his finest LPs — and one of its highlights, “Lost In The World,” is constructed around that very song; it opens with a direct sample: “I’m up in the woods / I’m down on my mind.” Another example, though less famous: Sufjan Stevens, who crafts everything from the bittersweet-acoustic &lt;em&gt;Carrie and Lowell&lt;/em&gt; to the sweeping multi-instrumentation of &lt;em&gt;Illinois&lt;/em&gt; and omnipresent synthesizers on &lt;em&gt;The Age of Adz&lt;/em&gt;, is a favorite of Childish Gambino — he actually remixed the whole of Illinois in college under his original mcDJ alter-ego. Kendrick Lamar, arguably one of rap’s greatest artists ever, sampled one of Stevens’s tracks on a song off To Pimp a Butterfly. Try to classify Stevens or Bon Iver into any genre, though, and you’ll invariably fail. Even Kanye, as of late, evades any traditional classification — a rapper releasing a gospel album? One thing is clear: the best music, I have found, is that which falls between the cracks. Now, it’s not as if people haven’t tried to label it; “alternative” is often tacked on such albums. But could Bon Iver’s electronic-esque &lt;em&gt;22, A Million&lt;/em&gt; and recent &lt;em&gt;i,i&lt;/em&gt; be any farther from the wind-whipped wintery guitar of &lt;em&gt;For Emma, Forever Ago&lt;/em&gt; and the glistening horns of &lt;em&gt;Bon Iver, Bon Iver&lt;/em&gt;? Artists — even songs — are unclassifiable. Yet such music’s evasiveness of labeling is, in a way, what makes it so meaningful: it exists to capture that indistinguishable, fleeting feeling into reality, and in doing so, it blossoms into an art as powerful and legitimate as any other. Rap/hip-hop can be quite magnificent in its own right — and I am not detracting from its greatness. No single genre, though, can capture the full spectrum of emotion in the way that the &lt;em&gt;un&lt;/em&gt;-genre can. I find solace from the overbearing weight of consciousness in the retrospective sadness of Clario’s glinting “Alewife” (I adore &lt;em&gt;Immunity&lt;/em&gt; as a whole); the expansive, nighttime folk of Gregory Alan Iskaov; the optimism of Owl City; the wintery isolation of the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;For Emma&lt;/em&gt;. The conflicting emotions of Ritt Momeny somehow make my own feel a little less crushing. Julien Baker gives tangibility to my deepest sadness; Beta Radio exestentializes it and simultaneously grounds me in reality. Though this all seems, at surface level, quite far from the burgeoning rap of today, the two are much closer than is obvious, as evidenced most perfectly by Vernon and West’s recurring collaboration (they recently released another single, “Take Me to the Light,” alongside their friend Francis and the Lights). Ritt Momney’s melodies give way to avant-garde rhyming; on the other end, Juice WRLD drifts from the rhythm-heavy production of mainstream rap into melodic progressions. I’ve come to love Lil Uzi Vert’s “The Way Life Goes” — its heavy sampling of Oh Wonder’s “Landslide,” another sublime track, binds me even further to his words. In the end, this is all to say a simple thing: the conventional rap that’s come to define so much of today’s music is not the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; music. It’s artful in its own way, but it — as a genre — simply cannot stretch so deeply into the swelling well of emotion that music unbound by genre reaches so artfully. This other music exists, too, and it’s absolutely breathtaking. Maybe this is far-fetched, but it might just change your life. It certainly changed mine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Selecting the Cadet Colonel</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="or-a-recent-history-of-the-selection-process"&gt;&lt;em&gt;or: A Recent History of the Selection Process&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22"&gt;by Jack MapelLentz '22&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has that moment of realization — &lt;em&gt;who’s that person who stands in front at Formation? Why does everyone look up to them?&lt;/em&gt; And then you find that they’re the Cadet Colonel, leader of the entire student body. One question lingers within the recesses of the minds of many, though: how exactly is the Cadet Colonel chosen? I counted myself among that group for over three years, acutely curious about the process’s inner workings but never quite sure how to uncover them. This year, though, I turned to those within the selection process in an effort to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ceremony’s modern formality is quite recent, said Lieutenant Colonel DePuglio. “Additionally, it has developed into an event broadcast by Cadet TV and a mini-reunion with the recent graduates coming back from college. It is an awesome day… a celebration of STA!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before delving into the inner workings and details of just how this marvelous celebration comes together, let’s first establish what the position consists of. “The Cadet Colonel is essentially responsible for everything that happens, or fails to happen, within the Corps of Cadets,” said Colonel Hetherington, our Commandant of Cadets of two years. “He sets the tone, the priorities, and the vision for the remainder of the school year.“ At the same time, he ensures that the Corps accomplishes its mission — developing boys into men of character — and fosters the school’s four core values of faith, integrity, respect, and excellence. Getting into the nitty-gritty, when Colonel Hetherington says that everything is the Cadet Colonel’s responsibility, he means &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. Colonel DePuglio named a few of many duties: “Leadership, motivation, training, Cadet performance, drill, completion of events, dances, discipline, demerit management, counseling, uniform wear, assemblies, upholding of school standards, planning, inspections, reviews, traditions, and mentorship of younger Cadets” — and that’s not anywhere near a comprehensive list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting a Cadet to fill the role is an elaborate journey. “The process may actually start as far back as the freshman year with everything a Cadet is involved in, including, of course, grades and pursuing excellence in all he does inside and outside of school,” said Colonel Hetherington. The formal process, though, begins one’s junior year, when the gears of the Junior Officer process start turning in January. The seniors of that year choose the junior class’s “Top 20” — the entire JO process is, in fact, run by seniors. From there, those twenty Cadets partake in Super Sunday; though it sounds like a sporting event, it’s a spring day jam-packed with interviews and testing. At the end of the day, the field is narrowed to the “Top 14,” who are placed in some of the brigade’s top leadership positions, which they assume for the remainder of the schoolyear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once summer passes, the school ushers in its newly-seniors, and the Cadet Colonel selection process picks up right where it left off. We all know that final promotions take place the Wednesday prior to Thanksgiving, but it wasn’t always that way. “Before 1943, selection and promotion was conducted before school started in August,” wrote Colonel DePuglio. “The ceremony after 1943 was conducted around Thanksgiving — because that's when Captain Fleming's family received the Medal of Honor from President Roosevelt.“&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selection is handled by the aptly named Cadet Colonel Selection Board, which is comprised of the school’s Headmaster, who is a non-voting member and tiebreaker; the Upper School Director; the Director of Academic Life; the Dean of Students; the Commandant of Cadets; a student representative, who polls the students and represents their voice; and likewise, a faculty representative who does the same. Every voting board member has the same voice; no position has precedence over another when voting. Each competing Cadet is discussed thoroughly… but what exactly does the board look at?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was curious as to what traits made one worthy of becoming Cadet Colonel, so I asked what set any one contender apart from the rest. Colonel DePuglio mentioned some key personality attributes: they must be “humble, approachable, [have a] great sense of humor, love tradition, be respected and trusted by his peers as a man of his word, not be afraid to correct a Cadet if he is doing something wrong, a gentleman, passionate of all STA sports and co-curriculars (even the ones he does not participate in), have strong faith and values, help anyone, love the school, be positive all of the time, never quit, and always help others before himself.” Ms. Jaworski, the former faculty representative for six years, underscored the respect factor. “The similarities I have noticed among Cadet Colonels have to do with how other students regard them. While academics is one important factor, it is not the only one to consider. One of the questions discussed is "will the student body follow him?" However, just because a student is popular does not mean they are going to be Cadet Colonel.” As for what the Board itself looks at, Colonel Hetherington wrote that it “considers a variety of input to include academic excellence, extracurriculars, awards and achievements. The board selection is intended to be as objective as possible; however, we do take into account the "whole person" approach when determining who is best qualified for the position.” That holistic approach was emphasized by Ms. Jaworski as well — though academics are an essential facet, she said, it’s imperative that they’ve preformed well in their military leadership classes, and, most importantly, have the respect of both the faculty and students. In addition to all of this, to increase objectivity in the process, last year Colonel Hetherington implemented a system that utilizes a spreadsheet with all the collected data on the top Cadets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they’ve taken everything into account, the board finally issues its final vote, selecting the Cadet Colonel. From there, it’s up to the Commandant as to how to appoint the other five Cadets (this isn’t under the purview of the Board). The newly-appointed Cadet Colonel goes on to lead the brigade for the first time, assuming the position for not only for the remainder of their time at STA, but for well beyond graduation. According to Colonel DePuglio, “The Cadet Colonel must lead and advise in all aspects of school life…after graduation, he is the defacto class leader — keeping the class informed, and planning and organizing class events.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This whole process leaves us with some key points: first of all, and above all else, one must earn the respect of their class and the student body as a whole. Without that, the purpose of the position falls apart. Respect amongst the faculty and staff, too, is extremely important. It’s imperative that you aren’t dishonest — cheating is basically intolerable, and one must be worthy of trust. Secondly, diversified involvement is extremely important as well; all of the people with whom I spoke mentioned it. Being involved in not only athletics but also plenty of extracurriculars is a huge plus. Excelling at academics is very important, as well, though it’s not the be-all-end-all of the process that some may think it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one thing can sum all of the endless intricacies and facets of what ultimately distinguishes a Cadet Colonel, I think it’s this: they care about our school from the bottom of their heart; seeing it suffer any sort of difficulty would be like watching their own home falter. Because STA really is their home, from the building to the incredible people to the intangible brotherhood and everything in between. The position of Cadet Colonel represents something we all hope to be, deep down: someone who can be the ultimate leader and brother. If we all follow that ideal, we’re capable of things we could never have imagined. And it’s thanks to this time-perfected, ever-evolving process that we have some exceptional people to look up to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="mini-book-review-the-overstory-by-richard-powers"&gt;Mini Book Review: &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Powers&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, so this one is interesting. It’s entirely about trees — at the beginning, before everything comes together and they all wind up utterly intertwined, the characters seem completely unrelated and independent save for some random connection to trees. It’s almost as well-written as &lt;em&gt;All the Light We Cannot See&lt;/em&gt;, probably the most beautiful book I’ve ever read (and a fellow recipient of the Pulitzer Prize). But the key word is almost. Where &lt;em&gt;ATLWCS&lt;/em&gt;’s sentences float among the clouds, even in the stormiest times, Richard Powers’s in &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt; flip-flop between abstract philosophy and brutal honesty. And some can’t decide which subset they belong in. Regardless, though, there’s certainly something to be learned from the novel. Actually, there are far too many things to count that one could learn. Barbra Kingsolver, in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, calls the book “a gigantic fable of genuine truths,” which is a perfect description. Perhaps that’s why it’s the quote featured on its cover. Anyway, I had a hard time understanding it while in the midst of the the story, but this is absolutely a fable, albeit a multifaceted and lengthy one. Between the numerous moments of unshielded anger, small victories, and inexplicable defeat, we inch closer to an explanation as to why of all things humans would so ruthlessly destroy such complex and beautiful beings — beings that, some characters argue, are no less consciously alive than we are. This explanation, though, seems too complex to be put into words — in actuality, it’s probably closer to an understanding as opposed to any linear explanation. We can’t explain why we’re so powerless to stop ourselves from cutting these incredible things to the ground. Just like how we can’t explain how we know, deep down, that in the long run these trees will be just fine, while we will not. But we can only seek to understand and comprehend its infinite repercussions. Compared to a tree, though, that’s quite a small infinity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, of all of the thousands of barren miles, a drunken truck driver — one of our own kind — managed to crash into &lt;em&gt;L’Arbre du Ténéré&lt;/em&gt;, alone in the Sahara Desert, the only of &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; kind for over 250 miles. Every single minute of each and every day, an whole soccer pitch of trees is slashed, burned, and ground into nonexistence. And that’s only in the Amazon. I don’t know whether we’ve crossed the point of no return, or whether there is even a point of no return. Someday, at least, we won’t be able to go back to the way things are today. But this is terribly unsustainable. It’s a spiral into unraveling. Should we choose to do nothing, I doubt that we’ll realize it. One day, we’ll look back and realize that things aren’t the way they once were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So above all else, &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt; is indeed a fable, albeit a 502-page one. It is simple — humans are just doing what humans must — yet complex beyond all measure: we should be able to do something, but we are no match against ourselves. It’s a book that must be unpacked over a long time, if not across multiple rereadings. But, as with all fables, at its core lies a pithy central moral:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trees are not in need of saving. We are.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="mini-book-review-little-fires-everywhere-by-celeste-ng"&gt;Mini Book Review: &lt;em&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/em&gt; by Celeste Ng&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve decided to occasionally review books… here we go, I guess:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little Fires Everywhere first somehow flashes its story in your face, letting you catch a glimpse of what’s already happened. But the scene is soon shrouded in darkness again, leaving a negative imprint on your eyes and an innumerable amount of questions in your head. From there, Celeste Ng somehow paints an incredibly vivid picture of a heartwrenching struggle over a single child, upon which the 1970s-suburban ideals of Shaker Heights (which, by the way, is a real place and still exists) somehow stand and are pitted against the the reality of inevitable entropy… and reality itself, in which relationships, despite every bureaucratic effort to pin them apart, wind up tangled and hopelessly intertwined. Every pull on the strings only tightens the knots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book contains a story woven from plain thread into a colorful fabric, but the resulting textile is then ripped in half, after which its fragments are left to burn. It’s simultaneously mind-boggling, captivating, optimistic, and then hopeless. A house of cards is conjured from a messy deck, reaching higher and higher with the utmost precision and perfection - but a single misplaced juncture is tucked in the middle; no one notices, but a slight breeze soon rounds the corner… everything falls apart. That’s what this book is like. It’s all wonderful and beautiful, but then you realize that something must not be right, except before you have a chance to discern what dark cloud might be hanging overhead, everything collapses, the downpour starts, and lightning strikes in the form of Izzy. There will have been a million things that could’ve gone differently - in other universes, everyone would’ve lived happily ever after, but you’ll be left questioning why all the wrong things lined up in this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, at least to me, is still unclear. I think it must exist somewhere. Answers, in general, are very prone to tangles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="a-swimmingly-splendid-show-vistas-the-little-mermaid"&gt;A Swimmingly Splendid Show: ViSTA’s &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22"&gt;by Jack MapelLentz '22&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spring’s ViSTA musical was utterly unforgettable, proving to be yet another triumph of the theater program. Somehow, the incredible mix of talent managed to transform the de Sales Theater from an unassuming black stage into an suboceanic paradise. Each and every one of its intricacies was thoughtfully considered, and it showed: from Ariel’s transformation from mermaid to human, the perfectly-choreographed rendition of &lt;em&gt;Under the Sea&lt;/em&gt;, to the adorable &lt;em&gt;Kiss the Girl&lt;/em&gt;, everything was performed exquisitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curtain opens on Ariel, played excellently by Xuan Nguyen, in “The World Above.” Next, the pilot (portrayed by Colby Wong) and Prince Grimsby (Sam Cunniff) make their debut, joined onstage by the ship’s sailors. From there, the actors and actresses beautifully weave a tale of good, evil, love, hate, and everything in between. The graceful songs of the Mersisters follow; after this, Joe McMahon makes his appearance as King Triton. All too soon, though, the show’s antagonists slither onstage: Ursula, alongside her loyal companions Flotsam and Jetsam (portrayed to a tee by Janae Lorick, Nick Horst, and Jack Kelly, respectively), launch into their first performance, “Daddy’s Little Angel.” Finally, after the trio finally departs (for now), Ariel makes a magnificent return with the iconic standout solo “Part of Your World.” The Mersisters and Flounder swim back centerstage for “She’s in Love,” spreading news of Ariel’s newfound romance far and wide among the creatures of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here on, I’ll do my best not to spoil the plot (though if you’ve somehow managed thus far not to know the plot of The Little Mermaid, you have gained my respect). Some highlights of the ensuing scenes include the legendary George Budzius as Prince Eric in “Her Voice;” Ethan Kalafatich’s perfect voicing of Sebastian, especially in “Under the Sea”; the arrival (crash landing?) of Scuttle - played with an impeccable accent by Pawel Williams - alongside the gulls; “Les Poissons,” featuring Lauren Wohlberg as Chef Louise; and “Kiss the Girl,” again featuring Ethan as Sebastian in its lead role. All this ends in a stunning finale, with the full company joining each other onstage for a well-deserved round of applause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t yet noticed my generous use of superlatives, I loved the show. As I said before, every nook and cranny - from continuous swimming movements among those onstage to Scuttle’s aforementioned tumble from stage right to the show’s shipshape crews - is executed perfectly, with a unique flair characteristic of the amazing people behind the costumes. It’s made even better when one considers how everyday figures in their life, like those you run into in the hallway or smile at between classes, somehow manage to assume an entirely different persona and do so flawlessly. I find it incredible to remember that each of the people that I sit next to in my French class were the very same as those under the lights only a few nights prior. Some cast members are my oldest friends, and seeing them perform so splendidly and with such heart and soul reminds me just how lucky I am to know them. This personal connection adds a whole new layer of meaning to the show, and no mainstream production could ever hope to replicate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all of these aspects are combined, I find it nearly impossible &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to love &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;. Honestly, its only pitfall might be the lack of intense emotions à la &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Little Women&lt;/em&gt; - but it easily surpasses this setback through pure charm. It manages to entertain every single audience member, regardless of age, thanks to the immense efforts of the entire company. All in all, the show went, shall I say, &lt;em&gt;swimmingly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="ode-to-the-cities-97-sampler"&gt;Ode to the &lt;em&gt;Cities 97 Sampler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22"&gt;by Jack MapelLentz '22&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, November 13th, 2018, the iconic Targets of the Twin Cities opened up for another day of business. Their glass doors slid open across the metro, near-simultaneously, to those awaiting outside; on shelves were copies of the &lt;em&gt;Cities 97 Sampler Volume 30&lt;/em&gt;, aptly titled &lt;em&gt;The Final Chapter.&lt;/em&gt; For this day was indeed the conclusion to a beautiful, touching story: over its 30 years of existence, the &lt;em&gt;Sampler&lt;/em&gt; not only compiled unique, heartwarming, and intimate renditions of often-stunning songs; its sales also raised above $13 million for charities across Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely, the majority of you have never heard of the &lt;em&gt;Sampler.&lt;/em&gt; Perhaps you’ve been unknowingly touched by its charitable impact. Alas, a rundown: first released in 1989 (a year the Swifties will recognize), it consisted of seventeen songs, give or take a few, burned onto a CD yearly to be distributed on a crisp November morning at the aforementioned Targets. Some years, especially during the &lt;em&gt;Sampler’s&lt;/em&gt; renaissance, hardy lovers of alternative music would stand for hours in line outside Target’s doors in a freezing sea of snowflakes just to listen to 75-ish minutes of music. Why, you may ask? It’s basically impossible to beat its singularity unique, cozy, and idiosyncratic recordings of (usually well-known) songs. Most[^Some were recorded at Cities 97-sponsored events like the Basilica Block Party, etc] were recorded in front of an audience comprised of only a few people at Cities 97’s St. Louis Park-located Studio C, a name that, for me, instantaneously triggers a landslide of childhood memories: watching Kare 11’s weather channel (11-2!) before school, driving from Mahtomedi on I-694 as the sun rose, the worn gray lightly-patterned fabric seats of our trusty 2006 Saturn Ion. For many listeners, myself included, all these seemingly insignificant songs are inexplicably tied to their very identity as a “true” Minnesotan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every fall, as &lt;em&gt;Sampler&lt;/em&gt; release day inched closer, I’d sit in the left backseat of the black Ion staring out the window as traffic slowed at the Wakota Bridge; as we flowed among the cars, Brian Oake - then the voice of 97.1 - would mention a sample of one of the soon-to-be-released songs, and I’d quickly lose myself in the music. Finally, on the morning of release, after what seemed to me like years of waiting, my dad would rouse my brother and me well before the sun had graced the horizon. Those days, 694 was always empty. Passing from the frigid and dark morning, over snow-covered concrete, and through the automatic doors onto the fluorescent-lit white tiles of Target, the &lt;em&gt;Sampler&lt;/em&gt; always sat ahead in neat rows on the end of an aisle. Crunching through the powder back to the Ion, we would slide it into its now-antiquated CD player, embarking on the year’s musical tale once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after this, at school: “Jack, why are you late?” they’d ask me. “Sorry. We were getting the Cities 97 Sampler,” I’d reply, stated as a fact, as if there was no alternative… and, honestly, there was none. By then, the &lt;em&gt;Sampler&lt;/em&gt; was long ingrained within my identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between then and now, years passed, life whizzed by, and the &lt;em&gt;Sampler’s&lt;/em&gt; volume number increased without relent. CDs faded into obsolescence, but it remained committed to the medium. I, and probably many other listeners, never considered that a November sans &lt;em&gt;Sampler&lt;/em&gt; would ever come. But come it did; on October 3rd, the station announced that Volume 30 would be its last. CDs, they said, simply weren’t prevalent enough anymore. No one even had devices that could play them, and regulations for digital releases are significantly more byzantine than physical ones. My heart sank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty-one days later, we entered our garage and climbed my dad’s car, no longer the Ion. I now sat in the passenger seat, not the back, driving to the nearest Target. We passed through the automatic doors from the chilly, gray day into the store. The shelves were empty. They had sold out. Oh well. That’s just how it would have to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, looking through my slightly insane number of tabs on my computer, I clicked on one that I’d left open for months: Target’s page for the &lt;em&gt;Sampler’s&lt;/em&gt; Volume 30. “Add to cart,” it said. Huh. So we did as the button said; days later, it showed up in a little cardboard box in our tattered mailbox. I now hold it in my hand, waiting to pull the old MacBook out from under my bed, the only device in our house equipped to import CDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before that, I think I’ll listen to the older volumes. You simply can’t beat The Fray and Death Cab for Cutie on Volume 18; The Head and the Heart, Farewell Milwaukee, and Mumford &amp;amp; Sons on Volume 23; Brandi Carlile on Volume 24; or Colbie Caillat, John Mayer, and Guster on Volume 22 - which is perhaps my favorite. On its closing track, Ingrid Michaelson says, introducing the song, “Um, we’re gonna do a Mexican song. Well, it’s a- it’s the song ‘Ode to Mexican Food,’” before launching into a jovial cover of &lt;em&gt;Maybe,&lt;/em&gt; from her own album &lt;em&gt;Everybody&lt;/em&gt;, except the lyrics begin with “I don’t know what I’m gonna eat tonight.” Or Ben Rector on Volume 28, replacing a line in “Brand New” with “I feel like windows rolled down / That’s because it’s hotter than it’s ever been before,” following up with “I feel like for the first time / I am in an oven that’s set to bake / I feel like any sort of baked item,” poking fun at an ongoing heat wave. When paired with their more serious counterparts, songs like these are what give the &lt;em&gt;Cities 97 Samplers&lt;/em&gt; a heart and soul all their own. And while we might not be getting a new disc every year, volumes of the past will undoubtedly live on in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now, I know well enough that, when all’s said and done, memories are sometimes the only things we’re left with. As you have most likely discerned, I lament the loss of such a musical staple… but is it really gone? Who knows; in the future, maybe it’ll come back. All in all, I’m simply grateful that I ever had the chance to experience its era. I’m grateful for its charitable aspect and the countless lives impacted. I’m grateful for all the incredibly talented artists that performed at Studio C, and the masterpieces they’ve created. But, above all, I’m grateful for the way that the &lt;em&gt;Cities 97 Sampler&lt;/em&gt; has shaped my musical taste, and, by extension, me, for music is embedded within my consciousness. I think that I can say without doubt that without the &lt;em&gt;Sampler&lt;/em&gt; I would be a noticeably different person. It’s the little things that keep us afloat in this crazy, beautiful river of life. I remind you: realize and acknowledge them while they’re still among you; when they flow away, recall how much you loved them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2 id="or-a-rather-protracted-exploration-of-a-few-changes-in-st-thomas-academys-history"&gt;&lt;em&gt;or:&lt;/em&gt; A Rather Protracted Exploration of a Few Changes in St. Thomas Academy’s History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22"&gt;by Jack MapelLentz ’22&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saint Thomas Academy often likes to humbly boast, in a way, about its rich and colorful history. Years compounded upon years of knowledge, enlightenment, and experience stand behind every new day of learning. Still, many Cadets have no way of understanding the full scope of the events that have taken place within the school’s one hundred and thirty-four year lifespan. I counted myself one among them - that is, until recently, when my interest was piqued by a conversation with an uncle and former student. New questions, previously hidden in plain sight, swirled around my head: &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; exactly had happened in the school’s myriad years of existence? what was STA like for those who walked the halls of yesteryear? and how were those very halls different than they are today? In an attempt to grasp how our school has evolved through the ages, and discover what changes might have taken place, I turned to Cadets from years past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s spin the clock back to 1958, when NASA was formed, Sputnik still orbited the Earth, and Elvis was all over the radio. Gerald, better known as Gerry, Brown was a senior at STMA, still located on its shared campus with the College of St. Thomas. “My recollection of our facilities is that they were adequate for the times. We were the ‘poor relation’ to the college on campus - we were second in line to use the facilities, but they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; college facilities, so we had access to athletic facilities, lunchroom, library, chapel, et cetera, that were better than most comparable high schools. But we were considered a ‘bother’ to the college people!” More interestingly, the social structure at then-STMA differed greatly from today’s. Unlike the intercity friendships that are now a hallmark of the school, students then stuck to those with whom they shared a city. “The student body was generally divided into three groups with little cross-over: those from St. Paul, those from Minneapolis, and the boarders,” he explained. “Another grouping that sometimes selected your friends for you was the academic practice called ‘homogeneous grouping’,” under which “all the smart kids stayed together for every class,” seated alphabetically. Thus, students whose names fell in close proximity to each other inevitably bonded. One similarity to STA’s present social structure was the coterie-esque Crack Drill Squad, though, on the other hand, Mr. Brown recalls athletes being less tightly-knit than they often are today. Finally, the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; peculiar of STMA’s intricacies might have been its trifecta of “social fraternities,” consisting of groups that called themselves the Barons, the Ibis, and the Pits. They “sponsored an annual dress-up dinner dance, had monthly Sunday night meetings (at which drinking usually happened) and had pledging in the fall,” according to Mr. Brown, in which “the pledges wore crazy clothes and did crazy things and got paddled by the ‘pledgemaster.’” The Barons, I learned, were the most sought-after and consisted mostly of athletes and the so-called “Squadders,” whom Mr. Brown categorized as being “what was pejoratively called a ‘clique.’” The Ibis - its members mostly sons of blue-collar workers - originated from St. Paul, while the Pits hailed from across the Mississippi, in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s move onwards through time, past 1965, when STMA became STA and students streamed into its shiny new Mendota Heights campus for the first time. Mr. Bob Slater ’77 had a unique view on the evolution of athletics at STA, being their director. “The facilities are far better today, [and] there are more sports/activities offered now,” he recalled, adding that the number of multi-sport athletes has dwindled over time. He also touched on a bygone era of simple small-scale community: “When I was a student, most of us had grown up playing sports with and against each other. Today, students come from so many different communities that they are not familiar with each other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Cadets, myself included, walk through STA’s many facilities without thinking about how they’d be standing upon mere dirt only a few short years ago. Nearly every graduate I interviewed commented on the many new structures that dot the campus. “STA has grown substantially since 1985 with the additions of Gerry Brown Stadium, The Hockey Arena, the expansion of the Middle School Building and of course Flynn Hall,” mentioned Mr. David Hottinger ’85. The construction of that lofty new building has certainly been one of the most influential events at STA in the last decade. "When I was at STA,” reflected Mr. Luke Marks ’11, “we had one gym, an incredibly small weight room, and one locker room. As a student I loved all of the different facilities we had, and never gave it a second thought, but now that I am a coach I think it is crazy that we were able to operate as a school with such limited facilities.” “We hardly had any of that stuff when I was there,” said Dr. Jake Lentz ’96. “All we had was a dusty field and the goat corpse we used as a ball.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common refrain in my research was the importance of the elusive-yet-concrete paradigm upon which STA metaphorically stands that’s been christened “the brotherhood.” “Certainly things have changed structurally… The one thing that has not changed is the ‘brotherhood,’” reflected Mr. John Kenney ’85, “I am still close with many of my classmates and always look forward to getting together. The dedicated faculty never changes. Though the faces may change, there has always been a caring and loving atmosphere." His classmate, Mr. Hottinger, concurred: “The brotherhood was a huge component of my experience. My classmates and those in the school cared about each other, challenged each other, had fun together, and in some ways policed each other.” Surprisingly, I learned that the very phrase “brotherhood” entered the vernacular of STA only recently. “When I was here, I don't recall the word ‘brotherhood’ being used,” said Mr. Nick McCarthy ’02. “The bond between cadets certainly still existed, but the use (let alone the overuse) of that word had not really begun in referring to the relationships between cadets.” Likewise, Mr. Marks echoed his remarks: “The idea of having everyone’s back and being more connected than students at other schools was definitely a thing, but we didn't use the word brotherhood.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all these major shifts are fascinating, some of the differences in minute details are equally intriguing. Gerry Brown Stadium was turfless until 2008, according to Mr. McCarthy. In addition, eight forty-five minute periods comprised the pre-block schedule. “Formation used to be after first hour,” he told me. “Nobody slapped the podium after a formation announcement. There were no handshakes or hugs after the senior speeches. You just walked back to your spot in formation.” Lunch, too, has undergone quite a few changes. Many Cadets remember the era of Taher’s preprepared meals, prior to the entrance of SAGE. Even before that, though, it differed, with the option of several “a la carte options featuring lots of cookies, cake, pies, and donuts for sale” - an option that was “much less healthy, but quite good.” Besides STA’s food, Dr. Lentz vaguely hinted at disappeared relics of another era: “When I went to STA, it was uphill both ways, to and from. Also there were wolves… Do they still have the bomb shelter?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While learning how STA’s campus has changed through the ages, both visibly and invisibly, perhaps the most enlightening part of hearing from these past Cadets was listening to them recount their unique experiences as a student. “I think every cadet has a unique experience,” said Mr. McCarthy. “One unique thing was 9/11, which happened my senior year. That was something that I'll never forget. Other things include the new middle school building being opened and going to several state tournament games at the Metrodome and Target Center.” Another memory: “Formation was an incredibly special time during the school day. I was always drawn to the senior speech… even as a middle schooler,” reflected Mr. Marks, “Whether the message was funny, sad, inspiring, or anything else, I loved hearing them as a student, and still do as a staff member,” certainly something that I can attest to. Mr. Patrick Meisch ’10 provided a poetic picture of trench ball during his time as a student. I apologize in advance for the long quotation, but his prose is simply too eloquent to be cut. “Trench Ball was more of a spectator sport back then. The gym would be packed during homecoming and winter weeks with almost every student in the building, walls ringing with cheers and bleachers rumbling with stomps as the teams played with a fervor and passion unrivaled in today’s trap-infused echo of this vaunted bloodsport. The t-shirt jerseys smeared with sharpie and designed at 10PM the previous night are still around, though. This is one of the activities on which I look back most fondly because kids from all walks of life would get together, regardless of background (excluding the perennial crack drill fellas), to dip, dive, duck, and dodge for glory, or at least watch a couple of peers get smashed in the face.” My favorite memory, though, came from Dr. Lentz, regarding one rendition of the notorious senior prank. “When I was a senior,” he wrote, “some of the faculty were ribbing my class for not having done a senior prank the whole year. Then one day in the late spring, while the seniors were out of the school, someone or someones managed to lock everyone else in the school inside and on the upper and lower levels through some creative bike lock use and 2x4 placement. Luckily, there was a construction crew nearby with a diamond-tip saw, and they were summoned by a freshman who was sent out a window.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides investigating the changes throughout the school’s history, I also asked those whom I interviewed about how their time at STA shaped them as a person. Once again, I found, as is the case in many facets of life, it’s the people that make it special. “Well,” Dr. Lentz said when I asked him, “my N is 1, so it is hard to say. But definitely my friends. I was so lucky in my friendships. I still talk to my friends from the Academy weekly, and we see each other as much as possible. That is the biggest thing. All great human beings and all much better than I am in every way.” Both Mr. Hottinger and Mr. McCarthy expressed nearly identical sentiments, backing up STA’s reputation as a unique environment. Another commonality in the responses was the effect of St. Thomas’s rather notorious rigor. “I think overall, and keeping mind the N of 1, STA gave me a sense of the primacy of hard work and teamwork above most everything else. I’m not very smart, but I hustle, and I think the relatively intense and unrelenting grind of being at St. Thomas helped teach me that you gotta work.” Again, others agreed. Mr. Marks expressed his doubts that he would have been held to a similar high standard at another school: “At STA, I was always pushed to do my absolute best…If I hadn't gone to STA for school, I would be a much different person.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, hearing from these past Cadets gave me a new sense of place. Only now have I fully realized the importance of appreciating those who’ve walked the halls before me… and while I know that not all questions can be answered, it’s clear that the school’s every nook and cranny hides a story waiting to be dusted off, brought forth into light, and told. From the few that I explored in the making of this article, I came to understand that, while St. Thomas Academy will always ebb and flow and adapt to changing times, its foundation, having withstood generation after generation, is truly timeless.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="cross-country-citation-article"&gt;2018 Cross Country Citation Article&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id="by-jack-mapellentz-22"&gt;by Jack MapelLentz '22&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the incredible efforts of both the players and coaches - including Mr. Tony Kinzley, Chief Kimberly Freide, Mr. Andrew Hayden, plus Mrs. Anne McQuillan, the iconically kind Middle School coach - STA’s cross-country team has had an equally incredible season thus far. Despite the departure of Ryan Tracy (last year’s top runner), the varsity runners preformed exceptionally well, even against significantly larger schools, and the junior varsity is stronger than it’s been in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new training plan was implemented this year by coach Tony Kinzley, and it’s already showing its effects. “I think the new training plan is awesome,” said senior Luke Kolar, the team’s fastest runner, “I can already see improvements at all skill levels for runners this year. Also, I'm sure the team will see long-term benefits for younger runners who are starting on this plan.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the inaugural three weeks of the training plan, the competition kicked off on August 31st in Rosemount at the Irish Invitational (a two-mile race), a course that just so happened to be situated next to an active construction site. It was followed a week later by the Fairbault Invitational, a longer five-kilometer course. In Fairbault, Luke Kolar and Thomas Thurlow both received awards for finishing in ninth and eighteenth place, respectively. Overall, the both the varsity and junior varsity teams led a strong showing against schools with a significantly larger student body, especially that early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following two more weeks of training (including the rather notorious VO2max intervals), on September 22nd, the team boarded a bus bound for Milaca, ready to compete in the eponymous Mega-Meet. The Cadets hadn’t made an appearance in three years, having last competed in 2015. An hour and a half later, they pulled into a rural street packed to the brim with buses: the Milaca Mega-Meet is one of the largest in the entire country, with over 160 teams competing. After walking the mile from the bus’s parking spot to the entrance, they navigated the sea of tents and began warming up. It wasn’t expected to be a “PR course” - that is, a course in which one sets their personal record time - but conditions turned out to be near-perfect, and every single runner raced their season PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did they run such wonderful races? A special emphasis on control: “The key to a successful race is to go out at a steady pace. A runner needs to be consistent, and that means saving energy to run even splits for the second and third miles. It's hard to master this skill, and some runners never do,” according to Luke Kolar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, the following Friday, the top ten varsity runners visited the University of Minnesota for a scouting practice of sorts. They returned the next day to experience (and race in) the Roy Griak Invitational, a meet in which incredibly fast college athletes compete - and a tough, hilly course. That night, they reconvened at Noodles &amp;amp; Company to continue a tradition from past years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 6th, the team made the two-and-a-half hour trip up I-94 to Alexandria, making a pit stop at St. John’s along the way (though a logistical hiccup meant that the seniors didn’t receive their beloved Johnnie Bread). Though they had to endure some, well, &lt;em&gt;questionable&lt;/em&gt; movie choices (you can thank Kevin Murphy for that), they eventually arrived at the Arrowhead Resort ready to race. Conditions were once again good, though the course was a bit sloppy, and in the end, the team once again held its own in a competitive race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to the future, the sections meet is only a couple short weeks away, and the team is optimistic. “I’m hoping that our team will win conference and perform well in Sections. Don't want to 'count any chickens before they hatch,' but I predict our team will see success in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be hard for someone who’s never participated in cross-country to fathom why all these crazy people would run their hearts out, but it’s human connections that make the sport worthwhile. “The best part of cross-country is the people. Whether it be coaches or people, running is actually a great sport for getting to know people - and the people I've met I couldn't be more grateful for,” said Luke. It is these people that make each and every day an unforgettable, unique experience… and this season, so far, has been filled to the brim with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;

    &lt;i&gt; Note: I wrote this late at night during a seven-hour car ride. To sum it up, I was bored and sleepy and tired (sometimes two different things, but I happened to be both), so I opened iA Writer on my phone and began writing. I don't know whether it's good or not, or if it's even meant to be measured on such a scale, or if it's meant for anything at all; only that it exists. And I hope that you enjoy it.&lt;/i&gt;

    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;

    &lt;b&gt;Seventy miles per hour.&lt;/b&gt; That was the most that the stationwagon was supposed to be going, but, like many things in this life, stationwagons are not known for their compliance with rules. If it could go faster, it would, and it did indeed. Ninety miles per hour, actually, was the speed its motor decided upon, regardless of whether Florence were to jump on or delicately brush the accelerator. She was alone, sitting in the driver’s seat, back locked and looking directly ahead at a pair of red lights that could easily have been a figment of her imagination. Slowly, the lights grew dimmer, until they were veiled behind a velvet curtain woven of loosely threaded fog. The erratic horizontal jerking of the stationwagon (until then a constant of the trip) eased into a floating sway, as if the tires were replaced by clouds - and where rubber would need friction and inertia to move, the clouds’ thought of going forward was enough for the ground to comply. Florence thought that she could see through the clouds for a moment, to a place beyond the night, where sunlight needed no sun to be born; it simply &lt;i&gt;existed&lt;/i&gt;. A unicorn might have smiled - she would never know for sure - but it was just as beautiful as any horse in this land. And then the red lights gently pushed back from reality, and Florence blinked - even with her eyelids closed, she could feel the darkness wrap around her and her car, but it was not a piercing darkness, it… it was a knowing darkness. And that, she thought, might have been just what she needed. She did not feel relief, nor warmth, but an understanding was enough. To know that not everything was okay, but that someday, it might be. She blinked again; now, a silent tear dropped out of her eye. Florence plunged back into the tumultuous river of life, but this time, she dove elegantly. The lights vanished again, and a wall of rain hit her windshield. The stationwagon bounced a little as if in surprise, but carried on just the same. And, after all, Florence did too.

    <content type="html">&lt;h3 id="i-recently-wrote-an-email-to-someone-summarizing-my-whole-experience-re-my-lungs-which-ive-been-meaning-to-do-for-a-while-here-it-is"&gt;I recently wrote an email to someone summarizing my whole experience (re: my lungs), which I've been meaning to do for a while. Here it is.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Early November:&lt;/strong&gt; I got some sort of [rather minimal] cold, which took me a while to recover from, as has always been the case for me (as a little kid, I used to pretty much never go to preschool: when other kids got sick for two days I’d be out for a week). Except when I got better from the cold itself, I continued coughing and wheezing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;December:&lt;/strong&gt; Everything just kept getting worse. I couldn’t breathe without being involuntarily forced into a forced expratory maneuver, which I’d taught myself to do (it involves compressing and squeezing all the air out of your lungs so as to wring out mucus blocking anything. When I first did if for her, my pulmonologist said that she’d never seen someone do it like that without being taught, and even then that it was super impressive)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;January:&lt;/strong&gt; I finally saw a pulmonologist, who soon diagnosed me with protracted bacterial bronchitis. I began a course of cefdinir (I think), as studies had shown that and one other antibiotic to be effective against the majority of cases of PBB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;February:&lt;/strong&gt; The cefdinir had greatly improved me, but I slipped back when the three-week course ended, so…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;March:&lt;/strong&gt; …on the 6th, I had my first brochoscopy. (sidenote: I had the worst anesthesiologist ever. She kept swearing in front of us, and then she left the IV needle thingy on my bed (thankfully my mom caught it, so I didn’t get hurt). When they put in the IV - not even any medicine - I fainted and kicked off my shoes. It was really, really unpleasant. I have an irrational fear of blood etc, so that was actually the third time I’ve fainted) It found 500,000 colonies/mL of &lt;em&gt;haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; in my right lower lobe (and hundreds of thousands in my left; I just don’t remember quite how many), plus a few thousand colonies/mL of three other kinds of bacteria. It turns out that the other of the two CBB-treating antibiotics - augmentin, aka amoxicillin/clavulanic acid - actually treats the &lt;em&gt;H. influenzae&lt;/em&gt;. Hence, I began a course of that. It again helped me, even more this time, but I slipped back once again (though I was still better than before).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;April:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t remember the exact date, but sometime around then the fungal culture came back from the bronchoscopy (it takes a few weeks, whereas the bacterial culture takes only days). Instead of the expected negative, it tested positive for aspergillus. I started seeing an infectious-disease doctor, too, and after some debate, I began a medicine called voriconazole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;May:&lt;/strong&gt; I stayed on the voriconazole for five weeks (near the very minimum course) but didn’t experience any impriovement. In addition, I got super sunburnt (which doesn’t really ever happen to me) and began experiencing skin breakdown (taking off a band-aid ripped my skin) and discoloration (my arms got all spotty). It also suppressed my appetite, or so my mom’s told me. Apparently voriconazole is a really intense medicine. Eventually I stopped taking it when I started developing hepatitis and had no positive effects. The aspergillus was, in essence, a red herring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;June:&lt;/strong&gt; I had my second bronchoscopy on June 6, which was incidentially the last day of school (I’d already finished my finals, having moved conflicting ones). It found a variety of other bacteria, which at this point I’ve lost track of. Somewhere in here I did a course of bactrum. Eventually…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;July:&lt;/strong&gt; …it got to the point where we’d tried pretty much everything. After a particularily bad day running (throughout this whole thing I kept on doing Nordic skiing and track), we were given two options: another steroid burst of prednisone, or going into the hospital for IV antibiotics. We ended up doing the latter, so I went into the hospital out of nowhere. I actually didn’t know that I’d be going in until the mid-morning, and we came directly from a bookstore. I left with a PICC line, through which I’d take meropenem (also used to treat anthrax!) every eight hours for the next five weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;August:&lt;/strong&gt; We started going into the Mayo Clinic, and after some consultation visits, I had my third bronchoscopy done, plus an endoscopy at the same time (I might be micro-aspirating in my sleep and contaminating my lungs in addition to all this). They also placed an impedance probe (a wire that went down my esophagus and came out of my nose), which stayed in for the next 24 hours. That was definetly one of the most miserable experiences of my entire life… they’d said that it would be quite unintrusive, but every time I tried to swallow or move in a certain way, some internal muscle involuntarily contracted, and it felt like it bluntly poked me deep inside the back of my throat. A few weeks later, I got my PICC line out. In total, we did 121 antibiotic doses at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that that kind of concludes the story so far! I’ve excluded the not-so-notable doctor visits and other miscellaneous things, but I think I remembered the major points.&lt;/p&gt;
